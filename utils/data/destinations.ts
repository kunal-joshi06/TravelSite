    desc: "Bali is one of more than 17,000 islands in the Indonesian archipelago and is located just over 2  kilometers (almost 1.5 miles) from the eastern tip of the island of Java and west of the island of Lombok. The island, home to about 4 million people, is approximately 144 kilometres (90 mi.) from east to west and 80 kilometres (50 mi.) north to south. The word 'paradise' is used a lot in Bali and not without reason. The combination of friendly, hospitable people, a magnificently visual culture infused with spirituality, and (not least) spectacular beaches with great surfing and diving have made Bali Indonesia's unrivaled number one tourist attraction.",
