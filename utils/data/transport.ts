We are currently actively preparing to re-launch India`s most-loved airline in Q3 (Jul-Sep) of 2022, with the promise of bringing back the warmth, understated elegance, and efficient operations that One Trip was synonymous with for 25 years.

What is more on the way back the flight was cancelled and I needed to wait in Mumbai for two days. Now it is not possible to get any refund from the airline as the ticket was bought via company in Europe. If they ever start to operate again do not buy tickets from that airline.</p>",

The plane was an old Boeing 737-800 with an unfunctional IFE screen, you must connect to the wifi hotspot to access the entertainment section. Although it seemed easy but it requires an app to access on phones. The cabin crew was mechanical at their work, food quality could be improved.</p>",

      desc: "Travellers love exploring India by road. The spellbinding landscapes provide a deeper insight into the culture and beauty of India. Unlike flights, travelling by road is much more intimate. That's why buses are among the most preferred ways among travellers to explore India. Moreover, countless Indians make their bus booking everyday to travel to other states. Besides private operators, you will also find that Indian states have their own bus services. You can find buses running from one city to another throughout the day. So, an extensive network of buses is connecting the different parts of the country and offering an affordable and easier way of travelling.",
